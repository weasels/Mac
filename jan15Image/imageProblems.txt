*Android studio settings, doesn't see all sdk stuff
*Scripts:
	* /Library/Networks/Scripts/commonImage-DSpostActions-killAccts.sh -> standardize SILC (rather than lateentry)
	* /Library/Networks/Scripts/commonImage-DSpostActions-networkConfigure.sh -> Common location check, Tbolt problems
	* /Library/Networks/Scripts/launchd-scheduler.sh 
	* /Library/Networks/Scripts/launchd-scheduler-cleanup.sh 
*Labstats update (Department/ucc/Applications/labstats.pkg)
